{"name":"Jslider","tagline":"jQuery Touch Slider plugin","body":"# jQuery Slider plugin\r\njQuery Slider is easy to use and multifunctional jQuery plugin.\r\n\r\nNote: As of v2.0.0 this library has a dependency of [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Bugs / Pull requests\r\nOriginal implementation by [Egor Khmelev](https://github.com/egorkhmelev)\r\n\r\nMaintained by [SalesSeek Limited](https://github.com/SalesSeek/)\r\n\r\nPorted to Typescript for better codestyle, and improved inheritance by [David A T Børresen](https://github.com/abdavid/)\r\n\r\nAdded grunt task runner for improved and easier build process by [David A T Børresen](https://github.com/abdavid/)\r\n\r\n## Build process\r\nYou need to have grunt installed to a manual build of this repo. When grunt is installed and available in the project directory you\r\nonly need to run `grunt build` which then will spit out four .js files under dist:\r\n* jquery.slider-bundled.js\r\n* jquery.slider-bundled.min.js\r\n* jquery.slider-standalone.js\r\n* jquery.slider-standalone.min.js\r\n\r\n## Tips & Tricks\r\nSince the original implementation has been improved to properly support touch screens, [Hammer.js](http://eightmedia.github.io/hammer.js/) was the library of\r\nchoise to do this. While doing tests on this on Windows 8.1 machines and tablets it has been suggested that adding\r\n\r\n    .slider {\r\n              -ms-touch-action: none;\r\n          }\r\n\r\nto your stylesheet is necessary to prevent IE from navigating back or forth in history when interacting with touch enabled elements\r\non your project. \r\n\r\n## License\r\n(MIT License) — Copyright &copy Egor Khmelev;","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
